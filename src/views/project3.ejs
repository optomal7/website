    <h3>taskr: going from todo to to-done</h3>
    <p>This was the culmination of my work in my 3rd or 4th week of learning to code as a pair. I keep this on display mostly to remind myself how far I've come and to motivate me to keep pushing forward. It currently lacks a live deployment, but the readme is quite lively at least!</p>
